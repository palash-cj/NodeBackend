# NodeBackend
Backend Project

HTML, JS, NODE(express.js), MySQL, (fetch module)

This is a small project which gives you a data for a date manually selected from a calendar.
As in the User selects the date from a html calendar for which he desires to have a data. As he clicks the relevant data is been shown at UI.

Basically the idea is like node based API's are created to fetch the relevant data from MySQL database. Html files enables user to select the date. Express framework is used to create API. SQL server is used to store and show the data.
